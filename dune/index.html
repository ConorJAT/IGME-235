    <h2>Game Description:</h2>
    <p><em>Dune: Imperium</em> is a game that finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from<br>
       Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson. You start with<br>
       a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents. As you acquire cards and build your deck,<br>
       your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board,<br>
       so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. Defeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions,<br>
       and acquire precious cards. The Spice must flow to lead your House to victory!</p>

    <h2>Notable Review:</h2>
    <blockquote>“I am a Dune fan, and I have really loved the base game and the way a very simple rule set has been used to capture the<br>
                theme and feeling of Dune. I also love how specific characters have been implemented in ways that make a lot of sense e.g.<br>
                using Stilgar as an agent gives you a water which means... you can go to Sietch Tabr! If you are friendly with the Fremen of course.”<br>
