    <p>Goal & Audience - With this project, I wanted to create a simple website portfolio which I can use as a<br>
       gallery sort of site. With this style, I wanted to go for a more visually immersive site rather than one<br>
       that uses excessive amounts of text.<br><br>

       The key audience of this site would primarely be aimed towards companies that I seek to attain co-ops for,<br> 
       and eventually, post-college careers. I feel this portfolio would be a great opportunity for me to showcase<br>
       my personal projects and talents.<br><br>

       Because of the intended audience and goals, I intentially decided to go with a design that focused on<br>
       sections which the viewers can slowly work their way through without spending much time reading text.</p>
