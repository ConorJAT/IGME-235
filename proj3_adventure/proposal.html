    <h1>Project #3 Proposal - The Monster Pit</h1>

    <p>For my Project #3, I would like to expand upon the 'DOM Adventure!' starter
       and create a JavaScript game/experience, where the player must battle waves 
       of enemies and bosses, slowly getting more difficult the more waves the player
       completes.<br><br>

       As the player persists through the onslaught, they must be constantly watching
       their weapon use and inventory space, as each weapon has 'x' amount of uses and
       the player can only hold so much before their pack is full. The player will also
       have 3 lives, each with a certain amount of HP. Once all lives are lost,
       it's game over.<br><br>
       
       There will also be several types of enemies, which will span from different movement
       patterns to different attack patterns. Additionally, every xth stage, the player
       will encounter a boss in the player will really have to keep track of item usage.<br>
