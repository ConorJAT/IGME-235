        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="mainText">Ave (Hello)! My name is Conor Race, I am a second year Game Design and Development Major, and my 
        preferred pronouns are he/him/his or they/them/theirs! A little bit about me...hmmm...well for starters, I 
        am very passionate about video games (if that wasn't obvious before). Some of my top favorites include:
        Sonic Mania, Pokemon: Shield, Minecraft, Portal 2, and Super Smash Bros: Ultimate. Additionally, I also
        enjoy listening to music, drawing/animation, social outings, and tabletop gaming.<br><br>

        By being a part of IGME.235, I hope to gain a fundamental understanding for how the web operates,
        as well as start gaining skills, which will allow me to create websites for key projects, such as
        my co-op portfolio. Apart from that, I continue stiving to become better and better at game dev!
        Down the road, I hope that someday I'll be working with an indie game dev team to help produce new up
        and coming games; either that, or I would really like to start my own development team! But until then,
        I'll be here at RIT, enjoying my time and experiences here till the very end! :)</p>
