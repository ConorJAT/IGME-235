    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Ave (Hello)! My name is Conor Race, I am a second year Game Design and Development Major, and my preferred pronouns<br>
       are he/him/his or they/them/theirs! A little bit about me...hmmm...well for starters, I am very passionate about video games<br>
       (if that wasn't obvious before). Some of my top favorites include: Sonic Mania, Pokemon: Shield, Minecraft, Portal 2,<br>
       and Super Smash Bros: Ultimate. Additionally, I also enjoy listening to music, drawing/animation, social outings, and tabletop gaming.<br><br>

       By being a part of IGME.235, I hope to gain a fundamental understanding for how the web operates, as well start gaining skills,<br> 
       which will allow me to create websites for key projects, such as my co-op portfolio. Apart from that, I continue stiving to become<br>
       better and better at game dev! Down the road, I hope that someday I'll be working with an indie game dev team to help produce new<br>
       up and coming games; either that, or I would really like to start my own development team! But until then, I'll be here at RIT, enjoying<br>
       my time and experiences here till the very end! :)</p>
